the Shopping App Main Page is a project I developed as part of my Front End course. My aim was to produce a page that is visually attractive and easy to use while meeting the UX design requirements. I used my knowledge of HTML&CSS to achieve this objective and ensure that the page fits the necessary dimensions.

you will find essential features like a navigation menu, links to the user's account, shopping cart, and wishlist.

To ensure that users enjoy a seamless shopping experience, I optimized the page to load quickly. Creating the Main Page allowed me to apply my Front End knowledge and hone my skills in producing functional and visually appealing web pages. In summary, this mini project is a testament to my dedication and commitment to delivering quality work.
